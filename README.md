## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

Predicting student performance is a crucial task in educational research. This project aims to understand the impact of various factors on academic success and provide actionable insights to enhance learning outcomes. The study involves:

- **Dataset**: UCI Student Performance dataset.
- **Objective**: Predict final grades (G3) under three scenarios:
  1. Using all features.
  2. Excluding the second-period grade (G2).
  3. Excluding both the first-period grade (G1) and G2.
- **Prediction Tasks**:
  - **Binary Classification**: Pass/Fail prediction.
  - **5-Level Classification**: Categorizing grades into 5 levels.
  - **Regression**: Predicting continuous final grades.
